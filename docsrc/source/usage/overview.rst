Overview 
-------------------

Current Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, we mainly use 🤖 **RecBOT** for three usage scenarios:

1. **Load Existing Models**: Load the modules or models in 🤖 **RecBOT** with one-line code.
2. **Interact with Models**: Chat to 🤖 **RecBOT** models to get recommendations.
3. **Develop New Models**: Develop new CRS models with 🤖 **RecBOT**, and share them with others.

Future Plan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since 🤖 **RecBOT** is modular, portable and interactive, we plan to use it for more scenarios:

1. **Benchmarking**: Build a benchmark for CRS models, similar to this `Huggingface leaderboard <https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard>`_.
2. **User Studies**: Add more features to the interactive features to ease the user studies.
