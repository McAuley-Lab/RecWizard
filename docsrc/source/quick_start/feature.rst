With the seamless compatibility of the Huggingface, stemming from our design principles to "let modules communicate in natural language" while "exposing low-level APIs to users", RecBOT shows the following properties:

- **Modular**: CRS model = (lower) *module level* + (higher) *model level*.
- **Portable**: Share or load CRS modules and models from Huggingface Hub! 
- **Interactive**: Chat with CRS models via our interactive interfaces. 
- **LLMs-Friendly**: Implemented LLMs as different roles in CRS models.
