Concepts

We abstract a CRS model to two levels as shown in the main figure:

- **Module Level**: we typically provide a `rectbot.BaseModule` for making recommendations and another `rectbot.BaseModule` for generating natural-language responses, we can further introduce processor `rectbot.BaseModule` to extract important information (e.g., entity linking) from users' raw features;
- **Pipeline Level**: we treat a `rectbot.BasePipline` is a high-level manager to decide when and how to call the lowe-level modules, and how to combine the results from such modules.

By default, all the modules are communicating in natural-language (e.g., **text data**) formats, which is the key to make all the modules as replaceable as possible; we still expose low-level methods for developers to define module communications via **tensor data** in a flexible and differentiable way.
