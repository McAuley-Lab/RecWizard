## Use Cases

### Case 1: Use Pre-trained Pipeline as a Whole

After installing [ü§ñÔ∏è RecBOT](./index), we quickly load pre-trained a Converstional Recommender Bot as follows:

```python
import recwizard import Model
from transformers import pipeline

model = Model.from_pretrained('ReDIAL')
pipe = pipeline(model=model, device='cuda:0')

pipe("Recommend me some popular and classic movies")
```

We input the conversation history and get the results from the pre-trained [ReDIAL](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/file/800de15c79c8d840f4e78d3af937d4d4-Paper.pdf) pipeline.

```bash
'The Shawshank Redemption (1994) \n
 The Godfather (1972) \n 
 The Dark Knight (2008) \n 
 The Godfather: Part II (1974) \n 
 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)'
```


### Case 2: Use Finer-Grained Pre-trained Components

We also provide finer-grained control on different modules of a Converstional Recommender Bot as follows. 
We also explain the details of different modules [here](./zoo/overview).

```python
from recwizard import Model
from recwizard import AutoModule

model = Model(
    processor = AutoModule.from_pretrained(HRNNForClassification"),
    manager = AutoModule.from_pretrained("RedialManager"),
    recommender = AutoModule.from_pretrained("AutoRec"),
    generator = AutoModule.from_pretrained("SwitchingDecoder"),
    aggregator = None,
)
```

Then, this initialized `model` can be used in a similar way as Case 1:

```python
pipe = pipeline(model=model, device='cuda:0')
pipe("Recommend me some popular and classic movies")
```

We input the conversation history and get the results from the pre-trained [ReDIAL](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/file/800de15c79c8d840f4e78d3af937d4d4-Paper.pdf) pipeline.

```bash
'The Shawshank Redemption (1994) \n
 The Godfather (1972) \n 
 The Dark Knight (2008) \n 
 The Godfather: Part II (1974) \n 
 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)'
```

### Case 3: Launch Interactive Interface
