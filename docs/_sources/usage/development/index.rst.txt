Develop New Models
------------------

.. note::
    We are trying to make `RecWizard <./index>`_ development similar to Huggingface Transformers to reduce the learning cost and cognitive load for developers.

This is a simple example about how to create new `RecWizard` modules (such as generators, recommenders and processors) or models (such as UniCRS models).
In this tutorial, we aim to create and share a new model, called, NEW to go through the journey of contributing to `RecWizard`.
